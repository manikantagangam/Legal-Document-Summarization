Instructions for the NLP research project [Max marks: 20]

1. Make a team of either atleast 2 members or atmost 5 members. 
2. You will do a research project on "Legal Document Summarization" [Broad Topic name]
3. Download the dataset at the given url: https://zenodo.org/record/7151679 [dataset.zip]
4. All the teams are required to do the implementation/coding and produce summarization results.
5. For evaluation purpose, a python package ROUGE is utilized which is found at https://pypi.org/project/rouge/ 
5. Once implementation is done, you are required to write a report on your project under the sections: Introduction, Literature Survey, Dataset Description, Methodology, Experimental Setup, Experimental results, Discussion and Conclusion [atleast 8 pages atmost 12 pages]. Also include the references at the end of the paper.
Note: The section headings can be modified as per the requirement.

 
In case of IN-Abs dataset, 7030 (document, summary) pairs are randomly sampled as the training dataset. The remaining 100 (document, summary) pairs are considered as the test set. The directory structure is as follows:

├── train-data                    # folder contains documents and summaries for training
│   ├── judgement              
│   ├── summary             
│   ├── stats-IN-train.txt        # text file containing the word and sentence count statistics of the documents
└── test-data                     # folder contains documents and summaries for test
│   ├── judgement              
│   ├── summary
│   ├── stats-IN-test.txt         # text file containing the word and sentence counts of the judgements & the summaries


IN-Ext: This dataset contains 50 Indian Supreme Court case documents and their extractive summaries. For each document, there are two summaries written individually by two law experts A1 and A2. Each summary by each law expert is of two types : full & segment-wise.

"full" : a coherent piece of summary.

"segment-wise" : the following segments are considered -- 'analysis', 'argument', 'facts', 'judgement', 'statute'. A "full" summary is broken down into these segments. Each segment is a folder.

More details can be found in the associated README file of the dataset repository.

The directory structure is as follows:

.
├── judgement                 # folder contains documents           
├── summary    
│   ├── full                  # folder contains full summaries
│   │   ├── A1
│   │   ├── A2
│   ├── segment-wise          # folder contains segment-wise summaries
│   │   ├── A1
│   │   ├── A2
├── IN-EXT-length.txt         # text file containing the word and sentence counts of the judgements & the summaries
